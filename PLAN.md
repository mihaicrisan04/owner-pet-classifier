# Real-Time Owner and Pet Classification System - Project Plan

## Phase 1: Planning and Setup (1-2 days)
- [x] Create GitHub repository
- [x] Set up project structure
- [x] Install core dependencies
- [ ] Document ethical guidelines
- [ ] Finalize technical decisions

### Technical Decisions
1. Face Detection Method: Using dlib for robust face detection and landmark localization
2. Pet Detection Method: Using YOLO for initial object detection followed by custom classification
3. Model Architecture: 
   - Pre-trained ResNet50 as feature extractor
   - Custom classification layers for specific identification
4. Storage: Local encrypted storage for embeddings and models

## Phase 2: Data Collection and Preparation (3-5 days)
- [ ] Owner Data Collection
  - Capture 20-30 images in various conditions
  - Different lighting, angles, expressions
  - Annotate with bounding boxes
- [ ] Pet Data Collection
  - Capture 20-30 images in various conditions
  - Different poses, angles, lighting
  - Annotate with bounding boxes
- [ ] Data Splitting
  - 80% training, 20% testing
  - Implement data augmentation pipeline

## Phase 3: Model Development (7-10 days)
- [ ] Set up PyTorch training pipeline
- [ ] Implement transfer learning approach
- [ ] Train and validate models
- [ ] Optimize model performance
- [ ] Implement embedding generation for owner identification

## Phase 4: Real-Time Integration (5-7 days)
- [ ] Implement webcam access
- [ ] Create real-time processing pipeline
- [ ] Develop classification logic
- [ ] Implement consent management
- [ ] Add privacy measures

## Phase 5: GUI Development (3-5 days)
- [ ] Design user interface
- [ ] Implement consent prompts
- [ ] Add real-time feedback
- [ ] Create enrollment interface
- [ ] Add privacy controls

## Phase 6: Testing and Refinement (3-5 days)
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Edge case handling
- [ ] User feedback collection
- [ ] Final optimizations

## Phase 7: Documentation and Deployment (1-2 days)
- [ ] Complete documentation
- [ ] Create user manual
- [ ] Package application
- [ ] Final deployment

## Ethical Considerations
1. Privacy
   - All processing done locally
   - No raw images stored
   - Encrypted storage for embeddings
2. Consent
   - Explicit consent required
   - Easy opt-out mechanism
   - Clear data usage explanation
3. Transparency
   - Clear documentation
   - Open about limitations
   - Regular privacy audits

## Technical Stack
- Python 3.9+
- PyTorch for deep learning
- OpenCV for video processing
- dlib for face detection
- YOLO for object detection
- PyQt for GUI
- SQLite for local storage
